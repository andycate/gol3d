# 3D Game of Life
This project is an implementation of Conway's game of life, but extended to 3D.
It's based on [this](https://wpmedia.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/13/2018/02/01-3-1.pdf) paper.

## Implementation
The graphics are implemented using OpenGL with GLFW. Bazel is used as the build system, 
and it is currently set up to build for Mac only, although it should be easy to extend to linux and windows.
